## Alexander Mak


>👋 Hey there! Thanks for stopping by!

> 😄 I'm Alex, a passionate software engineer based in the vibrant SF Bay Area! 

> ✈ My journey has been anything but conventional, taking me from materials lab research to managing autonomous vehicle projects and now diving deep into the world of software development. This diverse background has exposed me to various industries and incredible people, shaping my approach to life and work. While the question "where do you see yourself in 5 years?" may be tough to pin down, my overarching goal remains clear: to make a meaningful impact while doing what I love alongside exceptional individuals.

> 🧠 I am a lifelong problem solver and love diving into more abstract concepts. Though many dread studying data structures and algorithms, I love the puzzle solving aspect and have taken it as a hobby. I actually run weekly Leetcode sessions on my Discord. Let me know if that's something you're interested in! Beyond coding though, you'll catch me hitting the trails with my furry companion, geeking out over luxury custom keyboard parts, or honing my skills in competitive Tetris.

> 🤝 Let's connect and create something awesome together!
